> Javascript.

## Hello, World

- `crate-type = ["cdylib"]` is largely used for wasm file final artifacts today
- Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) via curl
- wasm-pack supports a variety options of target to bundle wasm

## console.log

- `#[wasm_bindgen(start)]` will be running implicitly after loading wasm
- binding js apis by `#[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console, js_name = log)]`
- using `web_sys::console::log_1`

## Small wasm files

- `[wasm-bindgen]` generate small size bundle
- `wasm-opt` can make it even smaller
- `wasm2wat` can make it quite smaller
- using `lto`, Link Time Optimization option for release

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
```
